# Bridge FAQs

## How long do transfers usually take?

Usually a transfer between chains takes about 5 seconds to complete. But depending on the congestion of the network you are sending to it can be longer. In some rare instances the bridge can take up to 20 minutes, this happens when liquidity is low and there is congestion. If you have any issues please jump into our dedicated [bridge telegram](https://t.me/evodefi_bridge_chat). The longest ever delay we have had was 1 hour when there was unprecedented demand so liquidity kept draining and needing to be rebalanced.


## What happens if it says there is no liquidity?

There is no need to panic, we have automated processes in place to ensure the bridge has stable liquidity on every chain. The rebalance process can take up to 20 minutes, so if there is a suggestion of low liquidity, please wait and try back again in 10-20 minutes.


## What address do funds get sent to?

When you are transferring tokens using our bridge, please make sure you carefully check the address you are sending to. The default address used is the one you are currently connected with as you can have the same wallet address on the different chains. When you are looking for your funds you have transferred, please be sure to be checking the correct wallet.

## What limits are there on the bridge?

There are some single transaction limits in place, but no per day limits. The single transaction limits are:
- USDC - $50,000
- ETH - $50,000
- GenX - No Limit
