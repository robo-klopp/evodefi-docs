## Overview of chains Evo DeFi Operates on:


### Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

We originally launched on BSC back on 12/04/2021. On BSC our community can do many things:
1. Yield Farming & Staking to earn $GenX
2. Buy lootboxes to earn NFTs which can boost your APR!
3. Bridge tokens across to any of the other chains we operate on
4. Buy & Breed NFT Monsters that can be used in the Monster Arenas
5. 'For Money' NFT Monster Battles (Coming back soon)


### Polygon (Formerly Matic)

Polygon was the first chain we expanded to and it was where we showcased our industry leading token bridge on 13/05/2021! Polygon is setup in a very similar way to BSC, so you can do the following:
1. Yield Farming & Staking to earn $GenX
2. Buy lootboxes to earn NFTs which can boost your APR!
3. Bridge tokens across to any of the other chains we operate on
4. Buy & Breed NFT Monsters that can be used in the Monster Arenas
5. 'For Money' NFT Monster Battles (Coming back soon)


### Fantom

Fantom was added to Evo DeFi initially as a chain which we can bridge to and from the rest of our eco system. Currently there are no emissions or a yield farm on Fantom but that may be updated soon, watch this space!


### Huobi ECO Chain (HECO)

HECO was added to Evo DeFi as just a bridge point to start with, but like with Fantom, don't rule out there being a yield farm there and NFT battles soon!


### Hoo Smart Chain (HSC)

We are working on adding HSC to our tool belt ASAP, we are planning to launch:
1. Yield Farm & Staking
2. NFT Monster Battles & NFT Monster breeding 
3. Lootboxes to buy NFTs to boost APRs
